# **Spatial Gap Analysis & Economic Potential Mapping**  
**Project**: The Transit Gap - Between-Stops Economy Analyzer  
**Objective**: Identify high-potential transit gaps using foot traffic, business density, and economic indicators.  

---

## **Scope of Work**  
Phase 2 focuses on **spatial and economic analysis** to pinpoint areas where transit expansion can create high economic value. The key tasks include:  
1. **Identifying High Foot Traffic, Low Transit Areas**  
2. **Overlaying Business Density & Economic Activity**  
3. **Clustering High-Potential Transit Gaps**  
4. **Quantifying Economic Impact & Prioritization**

## **Key Challenges & Mitigation Strategies**  

### **1. Identifying Transit Gaps (Foot Traffic vs. Transit Stops)**  
- **Challenge**: Need to detect areas with high pedestrian movement but low transit access.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Use **spatial joins** between foot traffic heatmaps and transit stop locations.  
  - Define a **transit coverage radius** (e.g., 400m buffer around stops).  
  - Identify **foot traffic clusters outside transit zones** using **DBSCAN clustering**.  

**Implementation (Python & Geopandas)**:  
```python  
from geopandas.tools import sjoin  
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN  

# Load transit stops and foot traffic points  
transit_stops = gpd.read_file("transit_stops.shp")  
foot_traffic = gpd.read_file("foot_traffic.shp")  

# Spatial join to filter foot traffic outside transit coverage  
unserved_traffic = sjoin(foot_traffic, transit_stops, how="left", predicate="within")  
unserved_traffic = unserved_traffic[unserved_traffic["index_right"].isna()]  

# Cluster high-density foot traffic areas  
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=300, min_samples=10).fit(unserved_traffic[['x', 'y']])  
unserved_traffic["cluster"] = dbscan.labels_  
```  
- **Deliverable**: A **heatmap of unserved transit zones** based on pedestrian demand.

### **2. Overlaying Business Density & Economic Activity**  
- **Challenge**: Need to understand whether transit gaps align with commercial zones.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Aggregate **business density** in the identified gaps using **hexagonal binning**.  
  - Use **revenue per business category** to estimate economic potential.  

**Implementation (Hex Binning in QGIS & SQL)**:  
```sql  
SELECT  
    hex_grid.id,  
    COUNT(businesses.id) AS business_count,  
    SUM(businesses.annual_revenue) AS total_revenue  
FROM hex_grid  
LEFT JOIN businesses  
ON ST_Intersects(hex_grid.geom, businesses.geom)  
GROUP BY hex_grid.id;  
```  
- **Deliverable**: A **business density map**, showing commercial potential in transit-starved areas.  

---

### **3. Clustering High-Potential Transit Gaps**  
- **Challenge**: Need to prioritize transit gaps based on economic & transit demand factors.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Define **multi-factor clustering**:  
    - üö∂ **Foot Traffic Intensity**  
    - üè¢ **Business Density**  
    - üí∞ **Economic Potential (Revenue Impact)**  
  - Use **K-Means clustering** to categorize high-priority zones.  

**Implementation (Python & Scikit-learn)**:  
```python  
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  

# Select relevant features  
features = unserved_traffic[['foot_traffic_count', 'business_count', 'total_revenue']]  

# Apply K-Means clustering  
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42).fit(features)  
unserved_traffic['priority_cluster'] = kmeans.labels_  
```  
- **Deliverable**: A **priority ranking of transit expansion areas**.  

---

### **4. Quantifying Economic Impact & Prioritization**  
- **Challenge**: Need a data-driven way to recommend new transit stops.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Calculate potential **ridership uplift** using historical transit patterns.  
  - Estimate **new job creation** based on improved accessibility.  
  - Develop a **Transit Expansion Impact Score (TEIS)**.  

**Transit Expansion Impact Score Formula**:  
\[
TEIS = (0.4 \times Foot Traffic Score) + (0.3 \times Business Density Score) + (0.3 \times Revenue Impact Score)
\]  

- **Deliverable**: A **ranked list of new transit stop recommendations**.

## **Next Steps**  
üöÄ With Phase 2 complete, we proceed to **Phase 3: Decision Support System & Visualization**, building interactive dashboards to help transit planners and policymakers.
