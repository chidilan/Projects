# **Decision Support System & Visualization**  
**Project**: The Transit Gap - Between-Stops Economy Analyzer  
**Objective**: Develop an interactive Decision Support System (DSS) to visualize transit gaps, economic potential, and optimize transit expansion strategies.  

---

## **Scope of Work**  
Phase 3 focuses on **building an interactive, data-driven platform** that enables policymakers, urban planners, and transit authorities to make informed decisions. The key components include:  
1. **Interactive Transit Gap Dashboard**  
2. **Predictive Transit Expansion Model**  
3. **Scenario Analysis & Business Case Estimation**  
4. **User Interface & Reporting System**

## **Key Deliverables & Implementation**  

### **1. Interactive Transit Gap Dashboard**  
- **Objective**: Provide real-time, spatial insights into unserved transit areas and their economic impact.  
- **Features**:  
  - 📍 **Heatmap of transit-starved areas**  
  - 📊 **Business density and economic impact overlays**  
  - 🚦 **Priority ranking of expansion areas (TEIS Score)**  
- **Implementation**: Power BI / Tableau with GIS integration  

**Power BI Data Model**:  
- **Tables**:  
  - 📂 `Transit_Stops`: Existing stops, ridership, service frequency  
  - 🏢 `Business_Data`: Density, revenue, job creation potential  
  - 🚶 `Foot_Traffic`: Heatmap data of pedestrian movement  
  - 📍 `Transit_Gap_Clusters`: Identified unserved transit areas  

**Power BI Measures Example** (TEIS Score Calculation):  
```DAX  
TEIS Score =  
    0.4 * SUM(Foot_Traffic[Intensity]) +  
    0.3 * SUM(Business_Data[Business_Density]) +  
    0.3 * SUM(Business_Data[Revenue_Impact])
```  
- **Deliverable**: A **live dashboard** for real-time transit gap analysis.

### **2. Predictive Transit Expansion Model**  
- **Objective**: Forecast the impact of adding transit stops based on demand, economic activity, and transit patterns.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Use **machine learning** to predict ridership potential.  
  - Model **accessibility improvements** for businesses and communities.  
  - Optimize **stop placements** for maximum economic benefit.  

**Implementation (Python & XGBoost for Predictive Modeling)**:  
```python  
from xgboost import XGBRegressor  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  

# Features: foot traffic, business density, transit accessibility  
X = transit_data[['foot_traffic', 'business_density', 'existing_transit_access']]  
y = transit_data['projected_ridership']  

# Train model  
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)  
model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)  
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  

# Predict ridership for new transit stops  
new_stops['predicted_ridership'] = model.predict(new_stops[['foot_traffic', 'business_density', 'existing_transit_access']])  
```  
- **Deliverable**: **Predicted ridership & economic impact for proposed stops**.

### **3. Scenario Analysis & Business Case Estimation**  
- **Objective**: Evaluate different transit expansion scenarios to maximize economic impact.  
- **Scenarios**:  
  - 🚇 **New stop placements based on TEIS ranking**  
  - 🚏 **Increased transit frequency in key corridors**  
  - 🏙️ **Integration with future urban development projects**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate economic uplift  
  - **Cost-benefit analysis** of transit expansion investments  
  - **Impact visualization** of different policy decisions  

**Example Monte Carlo Simulation (Python)**:  
```python  
import numpy as np  

# Define variables (estimated uplift range)  
economic_uplift = np.random.normal(loc=50000, scale=10000, size=1000)  

# Simulate impact of adding a new transit stop  
simulation_results = [np.mean(np.random.choice(economic_uplift, 100)) for _ in range(1000)]  

# Calculate confidence interval  
ci_lower, ci_upper = np.percentile(simulation_results, [5, 95])  
```  
- **Deliverable**: **Dynamic scenario reports with cost-benefit insights**.

### **4. User Interface & Reporting System**  
- **Objective**: Build an intuitive interface for policymakers to explore insights and make data-backed decisions.  
- **Features**:  
  - 📈 **Customizable filters (time, region, industry impact, etc.)**  
  - 📊 **Automated reports & recommendations**  
  - 🔍 **Drill-down insights on transit gaps and business growth opportunities**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Power BI Embedded for **self-service analytics**  
  - Web-based dashboard using **React + Leaflet.js** for interactive mapping  
  - Automated email reports via **Power Automate**  

**Example Power Automate Flow for Monthly Reports**:  
- Trigger: **End of Month**  
- Action 1: Generate **Power BI Report Snapshot**  
- Action 2: Attach PDF & Send Email to Stakeholders  

- **Deliverable**: **Automated decision support system for transit authorities**.  

---

## **Final Outcome & Impact**  
**The Transit Gap Analyzer will provide a comprehensive, data-driven strategy to optimize transit expansion, improve accessibility, and unlock economic potential.**  

Next steps: Deployment, stakeholder workshops, and iterative refinements.
