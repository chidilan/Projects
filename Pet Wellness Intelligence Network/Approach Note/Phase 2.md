# **Predictive Health & Preventive Care**  

### **Objective**  
Leverage the unified pet health database from Phase 1 to develop **AI-driven predictive analytics** that detect early signs of illness and recommend preventive care measures, ensuring **proactive pet health management**.  

---

## **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

### **1. Predicting Health Issues Before Symptoms Appear**  
**Challenge:**  
- Vets rely on manual pattern recognition for early diagnosis, leading to **delayed interventions**.  
- Existing **EHR systems lack predictive capabilities** and only store past treatments.  

**Solution:**  
- Deploy a **machine learning model** trained on IoT pet behavior data and historical medical records to predict common health issues (e.g., arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease).  
- Use **time-series anomaly detection** to flag deviations in pet activity and vitals.  

**Action Plan:**  
‚úÖ Train models using **500K+ digitized pet records** and IoT data streams.  
‚úÖ Implement **real-time alerts** for anomalies in pet behavior.  

**Model Example (Anomaly Detection for Arthritis)**  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Simulated pet activity data (steps per day)
activity_data = np.array([8000, 8200, 7900, 8100, 5000, 4900, 4700]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Train Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
model.fit(activity_data)

# Detect anomalies
anomalies = model.predict(activity_data)
print(anomalies)  # Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1] (Negative values indicate potential arthritis)
```

### **2. Personalized Preventive Care Plans**  
**Challenge:**  
- Vet recommendations are generic, lacking personalization based on **breed, weight, and age**.  

**Solution:**  
- Build an **AI-driven recommendation engine** that generates customized **diet, exercise, and check-up plans** for each pet.  
- Use **decision trees** and **reinforcement learning** to optimize care plans dynamically.  

**Action Plan:**  
‚úÖ Develop a **personalized wellness score** for each pet.  
‚úÖ Integrate AI-driven recommendations into **vet dashboards** and **pet owner mobile apps**.

## **Data Architecture & Workflow**  

1. **Data Inputs:**  
   - IoT collar data (weight, activity, licking, sleep).  
   - Vet medical records & diagnostic history.  
   - Breed-specific risk factors from **external veterinary databases**.  

2. **Processing & AI Model:**  
   - **Anomaly detection models** for early disease detection.  
   - **AI-based recommendation engine** for preventive care plans.  
   - **Real-time alerts & reports** for pet owners and vets.  

3. **Outputs:**  
   - **Vet Dashboard:** Risk assessments & suggested treatments.  
   - **Pet Owner App:** Proactive health alerts & custom care plans.  
   - **Automated Check-up Reminders:** Based on detected risks.

## **Expected Deliverables**  
‚úÖ **Predictive health risk models** with 85%+ accuracy.  
‚úÖ **AI-driven care plans** tailored to each pet.  
‚úÖ **Vet dashboard & pet owner alerts** for proactive interventions.  

---

## **Impact**  
üõë **50% reduction in late-stage diagnoses** for common pet illnesses.  
üìä **Early arthritis detection** in 70%+ of high-risk pets.  
üêï **Better quality of life for pets** with **data-driven, preventive care**.  

This phase shifts pet healthcare from **reactive treatments to proactive well-being**, ensuring pets live **longer, healthier lives**.
