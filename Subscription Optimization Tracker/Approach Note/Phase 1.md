### **Approach Note â€“ Phase 1: Discovery & Requirement Gathering**  

#### **1. Objective**  
To systematically identify business needs, key stakeholders, existing challenges, and project goals to establish a clear foundation for implementation.  

#### **2. Key Activities**  

##### **2.1 Stakeholder Engagement**  
- Identify key decision-makers and end-users.  
- Conduct structured interviews to capture expectations, pain points, and requirements.  
- Align on project objectives, scope, and success criteria.  

##### **2.2 Current State Analysis**  
- Map existing processes, workflows, and system architecture.  
- Identify inefficiencies, redundancies, and data silos.  
- Assess current data availability, sources, and integration gaps.  

##### **2.3 Gap Analysis & Benchmarking**  
- Compare current state with industry best practices.  
- Identify discrepancies between current and desired performance levels.  
- Define measurable KPIs to track improvements.  

##### **2.4 Requirement Documentation**  
- Categorize requirements: functional, technical, compliance, and user experience.  
- Prioritize based on business impact and feasibility.  
- Validate requirements with stakeholders to ensure alignment.  

##### **2.5 Risk Assessment**  
- Identify potential risks (technical, operational, and compliance-related).  
- Establish mitigation strategies and contingency plans.  

#### **3. Deliverables**  
- **Requirement Specification Document** (detailed business, functional, and technical needs).  
- **Current vs. Future State Analysis** (gaps, inefficiencies, and improvement areas).  
- **Stakeholder Mapping** (roles, responsibilities, and decision-making authority).  
- **Risk Assessment Report** (identified risks and mitigation strategies).  
- **Project Roadmap** (high-level plan outlining next phases).  

This phase ensures a structured and data-driven foundation for the project.
