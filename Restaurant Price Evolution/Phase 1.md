## Project Vision

To revolutionize our menu pricing strategy by systematically building our data foundation, analyzing historical trends, understanding the competitive landscape, leveraging predictive analytics, and ensuring seamless operational integration.

---

## Phases Overview

This project is broken down into five distinct phases, each building upon the last to achieve our overall objectives.

### Phase 1: Data Foundation 

> **Objective:** Digitize and structure historical menu data from various sources, ensuring accuracy and consistency for robust analysis.

**Key Activities:**
*   **Data Collection:** Gather menus (PDFs, scans, handwritten, printed) across all locations & time periods.
*   **OCR Processing:**
    *   Tesseract OCR for standard text.
    *   AWS Textract for handwritten/complex layouts.
    *   OpenCV for image pre-processing (contrast, noise reduction).
*   **Data Structuring & Standardization:**
    *   Convert to SQL Database: `Item Name`, `Price`, `Category`, `Location`, `Date`.
    *   Standardize names using fuzzy matching.
*   **Data Cleaning & Validation:**
    *   Automated anomaly detection.
    *   Cross-check with financial records.
    *   Manual review for **98%+ accuracy**.
*   **Error Logging & Refinement:** Track OCR failures, develop adaptive ML for future OCR.

**✅ Deliverables:**
*   Structured SQL database.
*   OCR accuracy report.
*   Error log & improvement plan.

**  Expected Outcome:** A fully structured and validated menu dataset.

### Phase 2: Trend & Cost Analysis 

> **Objective:** Analyze historical price trends, correlate menu prices with ingredient/wage costs, and identify margin gaps.

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**
*    **Data Gaps (Ingredient Costs):** Use interpolation, USDA API, BLS wage data.
*    **Update Lags:** Identify patterns, recommend optimal update intervals.
*    **Regional Cost Variability:** Create city-wise cost vs. price index.

**Methodology:**
*    **Data Aggregation:** Join menu history (SQL) with ingredient costs (USDA) & wage data (BLS).
*    **Trend Analysis (Power BI & SQL):** Measure price elasticity, compare cost increases vs. price adjustments.
*    **Margin Gap Identification:** SQL queries to flag items where cost growth outpaces price growth.
    ```sql
    -- Sample: Identifying Low-Margin Items
    SELECT city, item_name, AVG(menu_price) AS avg_price, AVG(ingredient_cost) AS avg_cost,
           (AVG(menu_price) - AVG(ingredient_cost)) / AVG(menu_price) * 100 AS margin
    FROM menu_prices JOIN ingredient_costs ON menu_prices.item_id = ingredient_costs.item_id
    WHERE date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
    GROUP BY city, item_name ORDER BY margin ASC;
    ```

**✅ Deliverables:**
*   Power BI Dashboard: Cost vs. price trends.
*   SQL-Generated Reports: Low-margin items, pricing lag.
*   Executive Summary: Key findings & recommendations.

**Expected Outcome:** Identification of ~$500K in margin leaks, optimized update schedules.

### Phase 3: Competitive Benchmarking 

> **Objective:** Benchmark menu pricing against competitors, assess market positioning, and recommend strategic price adjustments.

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**
*    **Competitor Data Access:** Web scraping, 3rd-party reports, surveys.
*    **Dynamic Pricing:** Categorize competitors (fixed vs. dynamic), assess volatility.
*    **Regional Disparities:** Develop regional price comparison index.

**Methodology:**
*    **Competitive Analysis:** Extract competitor pricing (delivery platforms, websites). Analyze positioning (premium, mid-tier, budget).
*    **Price Sensitivity:** Analyze impact of price changes on sales, assess demand elasticity.
*    **Market Positioning:** Map prices vs. competitors (Power BI scatterplot).
    ```sql
    -- Sample: Competitive Price Comparison
    SELECT a.city, a.item_name, a.avg_price AS our_price, b.avg_price AS competitor_price,
           (a.avg_price - b.avg_price) / b.avg_price * 100 AS price_difference
    FROM menu_prices a JOIN competitor_prices b ON a.item_name = b.item_name AND a.city = b.city
    WHERE a.date = '2024-01-01' ORDER BY price_difference ASC;
    ```

**✅ Deliverables:**
*   Competitive Pricing Dashboard.
*   Price Sensitivity Report.
*   Market Positioning Strategy.

**Expected Outcome:** Identification of 10-15% price misalignment, actionable plan for optimization.

### Phase 4: Predictive Pricing 

> **Objective:** Leverage ML models to optimize menu pricing dynamically for maximum profitability while maintaining competitiveness.

**Key Challenges & Solutions:**
*    **Lack of Predictive Models:** Implement ML for demand forecasting, price elasticity.
*    **Profitability vs. Retention:** Deploy elasticity-based pricing, segment items.
*    **Seasonal/Demand Adjustments:** Use time-series forecasting for dynamic pricing.

** Methodology:**
*    **Data Prep & Feature Engineering:** Consolidate sales, competitor prices, weather, holidays. Engineer features (day of week, seasonality).
*    **ML Model (Random Forest Regression):** Predict optimal prices based on historical trends, competitor pricing, elasticity, seasonal effects.
    ```python
    # Sample: Price Prediction Model
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    # model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # df['predicted_price'] = model.predict(X)
    ```
*    **Scenario Planning & A/B Testing:** Evaluate impact on volume, revenue, satisfaction.

**✅ Deliverables:**
*   Predictive Pricing Dashboard: Data-driven recommendations.
*   Elasticity Analysis Report.
*   ML-Driven Pricing Model.

**Expected Outcome:** Projected revenue uplift of 10-15%, dynamic price adjustments.
