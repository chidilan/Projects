### **Phase 2: Data Analysis & Insights Generation**  

#### **Objective**  
To derive actionable insights by analyzing cleaned data from Phase 1, identifying key trends, customer behaviors, and operational inefficiencies.

### **Key Analytical Focus Areas**  

| **Category**            | **Metrics/Analysis**                                | **Expected Insights** |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Sales Performance**   | Revenue trends, best-selling SKUs, seasonal variations | Identify high-performing products and peak sales periods |
| **Customer Segmentation** | RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis, Demographic Profiling | Classify customers into high-value, mid-tier, and low-engagement groups |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Order fulfillment time, stockouts, supplier performance | Identify bottlenecks in logistics and supply chain |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Price elasticity analysis, competitor benchmarking | Optimize pricing for maximum revenue and margin |
| **Loyalty Program Effectiveness** | CLV (Customer Lifetime Value), retention rates | Measure impact of loyalty programs on repeat purchases |

### **Analysis Approach & Techniques**  

##### **1. Sales Trend Analysis**  
- **Method**: Time-series analysis on revenue and product demand.  
- **Tool**: Power BI/SQL for trend visualization.  
- **Example Query (SQL for monthly revenue trends)**  
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Timestamp) AS Month,  
       SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue  
FROM transactions  
GROUP BY Month  
ORDER BY Month;
```
- **Expected Insight**: Identify sales seasonality and revenue spikes.  

---

##### **2. Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)**  
- **Method**: Categorize customers based on:  
  - **Recency (R)**: Last purchase date  
  - **Frequency (F)**: Number of purchases  
  - **Monetary (M)**: Total spend  
- **Tool**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn for clustering).  
- **Example Code:**  
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans  

# Load processed data  
rfm_df = data[['Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary']]  

# Apply clustering  
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)  
rfm_df['Segment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_df)  
```
- **Expected Insight**: Identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers.  

---

##### **3. Pricing Strategy & Elasticity Analysis**  
- **Method**: Measure how price changes impact demand.  
- **Tool**: Regression analysis in Python.  
- **Example Code:**  
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm  

# Define variables  
X = sales_data['Price']  
y = sales_data['Quantity_Sold']  

# Fit regression model  
X = sm.add_constant(X)  
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()  
print(model.summary())
```
- **Expected Insight**: Determine optimal pricing strategy.  

---

##### **4. Operational Efficiency â€“ Stockout & Fulfillment Analysis**  
- **Method**: Identify frequent stockouts and delayed deliveries.  
- **Tool**: Power BI/SQL.  
- **SQL Query (Stockout Frequency):**  
```sql
SELECT Product_ID, COUNT(*) AS Stockout_Count  
FROM inventory  
WHERE Stock_Available = 0  
GROUP BY Product_ID  
ORDER BY Stockout_Count DESC;
```
- **Expected Insight**: Improve supply chain management.
