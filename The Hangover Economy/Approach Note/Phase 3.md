### **1. Sales Performance Optimization**  
- **Strategy**: Implement dynamic pricing based on demand patterns and competitor analysis.  
- **Automation**:  
  - Build a **predictive pricing model** that suggests optimal price points.  
  - Integrate **automated discount recommendations** into the CRM.  
- **Example â€“ Dynamic Pricing SQL Query:**  
```sql
SELECT Product_ID,  
       AVG(Price) AS Current_Price,  
       AVG(Sales) AS Demand,  
       CASE  
           WHEN Demand > 100 THEN Price * 1.1  
           WHEN Demand < 50 THEN Price * 0.9  
           ELSE Price  
       END AS Suggested_Price  
FROM sales_data  
GROUP BY Product_ID;
```
- **Outcome**: Maximized revenue with real-time price adjustments.

### **2. Customer Engagement & Retention**  
- **Strategy**: Automate personalized email and SMS campaigns based on customer behavior.  
- **Automation**:  
  - **Trigger-based marketing automation** (e.g., abandoned cart emails, loyalty rewards reminders).  
  - **CRM segmentation** to target high-value customers with exclusive offers.  
- **Example â€“ Automated Customer Retention Workflow:**  
  - **Trigger**: Customer hasnâ€™t purchased in 60 days.  
  - **Action**: Send personalized discount email.  
  - **Follow-up**: SMS reminder if no response in 7 days.

- **Example â€“ Power BI Stockout Alert Logic:**  
```sql
SELECT Product_ID, Stock_Level, Reorder_Threshold  
FROM inventory  
WHERE Stock_Level < Reorder_Threshold;
```
- **Outcome**: Fewer stockouts, improved supply chain efficiency.

### **4. Data Governance & Automated Reporting**  
- **Strategy**: Standardize KPIs, automate report generation, and ensure data accuracy.
