Here's a detailed **Approach Note for Phase 2: Predictive Modeling & Forecasting** for the *Weather FOMO - Lost Revenue Weather Tracker* project.

# **Approach Note – Phase 2: Predictive Modeling & Forecasting**  
📌 *Objective:* Develop machine learning models to predict **weather-driven booking cancellations & revenue fluctuations**, enabling proactive decision-making at *SunnyDays Resorts*.  

---

## **1. Problem Statement & Business Goals**  
Based on Phase 1 insights, we will now:  
✅ Develop **a predictive model** to forecast **cancellation probability & revenue impact** based on weather conditions.  
✅ Enable **dynamic pricing & resource allocation** based on forecasted weather-driven demand shifts.  
✅ Identify **thresholds where weather risk is highest** and provide actionable alerts.  

---

## **2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**  
📌 *Goal:* Prepare a high-quality dataset for model training with relevant predictive features.  

### **2.1 Data Integration**  
We will consolidate:  
🔹 **Historical booking & cancellation data** *(SQL, cleaned in Phase 1)*  
🔹 **Weather forecasts** *(API-based, 7-day rolling forecast)*  
🔹 **Event & holiday calendar** *(Impact factor for demand surges)*  
🔹 **Guest segmentation data** *(VIP customers may behave differently in bad weather)*  

### **2.2 Feature Engineering**  
We will create **derived variables** for better prediction accuracy:  

| **Feature Name**         | **Description**                                  | **Feature Type** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `Rainfall_Last7Days`    | Rolling average rainfall before check-in        | Continuous     |
| `Temp_Deviation`        | Difference from average seasonal temperature     | Continuous     |
| `Weekend_Indicator`     | Whether the booking falls on a weekend          | Categorical    |
| `Event_Impact_Score`    | Demand boost from concurrent local events       | Continuous     |
| `Lead_Time`             | Days between booking and check-in                | Continuous     |
| `Room_Type`             | Suite, Standard, Deluxe (One-hot encoded)       | Categorical    |
| `Loyalty_Status`        | Frequent guest (Yes/No)                         | Categorical    |

Example Python code snippet for feature creation:  
```python
import pandas as pd

# Calculate rolling rainfall avg & temperature deviation
df['Rainfall_Last7Days'] = df['Rainfall'].rolling(7).mean()
df['Temp_Deviation'] = df['Temperature'] - df['Temperature'].mean()

# Encode categorical variables
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Room_Type', 'Loyalty_Status'])
```

## **3. Model Selection & Training**  
📌 *Goal:* Train multiple models and select the best-performing one.  

### **3.1 Model Selection**  
We will experiment with **three models**:  
1️⃣ **Logistic Regression** – Quick insights, interpretable.  
2️⃣ **Random Forest** – Captures non-linear weather impacts.  
3️⃣ **LSTM (Deep Learning)** – Ideal for time-series forecasting.  

| **Model**             | **Pros**                                     | **Cons**                                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | Simple, easy to interpret                   | Limited in handling complex patterns  |
| Random Forest      | Handles interactions well, robust            | Computationally expensive              |
| LSTM               | Best for time-based trends                   | Requires large datasets, training time |

### **3.2 Model Training & Tuning**  
- **Train/Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing.  
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold to ensure stability.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search for optimal parameters.  

Example Random Forest training:  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop(columns=['Cancellation_Status']), df['Cancellation_Status'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## **4. Model Evaluation & Insights**  
📌 *Goal:* Measure accuracy & reliability of predictions.  

We will evaluate models using:  

| **Metric**            | **Definition**                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**        | Percentage of correct predictions                |
| **Precision**       | % of predicted cancellations that were correct   |
| **Recall (Sensitivity)** | % of actual cancellations correctly predicted |
| **ROC-AUC Score**   | Measures model’s discrimination power            |

Example **Confusion Matrix** to analyze misclassifications:  
```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns

y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='d')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

Expected **Insights from Model Testing**:  
✅ **High cancellation risk (>80%) when rainfall > 15mm + temp deviation > 5°F**  
✅ **Events reduce cancellations by 25%, offsetting some weather impact**  
✅ **Bookings with lead times < 5 days are most sensitive to weather conditions**

## **5. Forecasting & Business Impact**  
📌 *Goal:* Apply predictive models to **real-time weather data** for proactive decision-making.  

### **5.1 Forecasting Cancellations & Revenue Adjustments**  
- Use **7-day rolling weather forecast** to predict cancellations.  
- Forecast **revenue impact** by estimating lost bookings per resort.  

**Example Forecasting Output (Dashboard Representation)**:  
| **Date**    | **Resort**  | **Rain Forecast (mm)** | **Temp Deviation (°F)** | **Cancellation Risk (%)** | **Revenue Loss ($)** |
|------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 2024-03-20 | Miami     | 18                   | +6                   | 85%                  | $12,500             |
| 2024-03-21 | Orlando   | 2                    | -2                   | 10%                  | $1,200              |
| 2024-03-22 | Houston   | 22                   | +8                   | 92%                  | $18,300             |

### **5.2 Business Recommendations & Alerts**  
🔹 **Dynamic Pricing:** Increase rates on sunny days, offer **discounts for upcoming storm forecasts**.  
🔹 **Preemptive Customer Engagement:**  
  - **Automate email alerts**: “Storm Alert! Free rebooking option available for impacted guests.”  
  - **Suggest alternative dates** to retain bookings.  
🔹 **Operational Adjustments:**  
  - Reduce staffing on high-cancellation days.  
  - Increase marketing efforts for dates with favorable weather forecasts.  

Example **Automated Email Trigger for High Cancellation Risk**:  
```python
if predicted_cancellation_risk > 80%:
    send_email(guest_email, "Weather Alert: Reschedule Your Stay with Zero Fees!")
```
