# **Approach Note – Phase 3: Automation & API Integration**  
📌 *Objective:* Deploy predictive models into a **real-time decision-making system**, automate alerts, integrate with booking platforms, and optimize **dynamic pricing & resource allocation**.

---

## **1. Problem Statement & Business Goals**  
With Phase 2 successfully delivering **predictive insights on weather-driven cancellations & revenue loss**, we now move to:  
✅ **Automate decision-making** by integrating models into operational workflows.  
✅ **Deploy real-time alerts & price adjustments** based on weather forecasts.  
✅ **Ensure seamless data flow** across weather APIs, booking systems, and dashboards.  
✅ **Create a self-improving AI system** that refines predictions over time.  

---

## **2. System Architecture & Data Flow**  
📌 *Goal:* Build an end-to-end **automated system** that integrates **weather forecasts, predictive analytics, and business operations**.  

### **2.1 Key Components**  
🔹 **Weather API** (e.g., OpenWeather, AccuWeather) – Fetch real-time & 7-day forecasts.  
🔹 **Predictive Model (ML-based)** – Forecast cancellation risk & revenue impact.  
🔹 **Dynamic Pricing Engine** – Adjusts pricing based on forecasted demand shifts.  
🔹 **Booking System (CRM/ERP Integration)** – Updates guests with alerts & rebooking options.  
🔹 **Power BI / Tableau Dashboard** – Visualizes real-time data for management.  

### **2.2 Data Flow Diagram**

                               v                          v
         [ Front-End Dashboard ]            [ Guest Notifications & Actions ]
```

## **3. API Integration & Automation Workflows**  
📌 *Goal:* Enable **seamless data exchange & automated actions** across platforms.

### **3.1 Weather API Integration**  
- Use Python scripts to **fetch live weather data every 6 hours**.  
- Extract **temperature, rainfall, storm warnings, humidity**, etc.  
- Store weather data in a **cloud database (AWS, Azure, GCP)**.  

**Example API Call (OpenWeather API):**  
```python
import requests
import json

API_KEY = "your_api_key"
location = "Miami"

url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={location}&appid={API_KEY}"
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.json()

# Extract relevant weather parameters
forecast_data = data['list'][0]['weather'][0]['main']
temperature = data['list'][0]['main']['temp']
```

---

### **3.2 Predictive Model Deployment (MLOps)**  
- Convert Phase 2’s **trained ML model** into an **API service (Flask/FastAPI)**.  
- Deploy the model on **Azure ML / AWS SageMaker / Google AI Platform**.  
- Set up **automatic model retraining** every 30 days to improve accuracy.  

**Example: Deploying a FastAPI ML Model**  
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("cancellation_model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict/")
def predict_cancellation(features: dict):
    df = pd.DataFrame([features])
    prediction = model.predict(df)
    return {"Cancellation_Risk": prediction.tolist()}
```

---

### **3.3 Dynamic Pricing Engine**  
- Adjust **room prices dynamically** based on forecasted demand.  
- Integrate with **revenue management tools** (e.g., Cloudbeds, Revinate).  
- Offer **discounts for high-risk weather days** to prevent revenue loss.  

**Example Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:**  
- If **cancellation risk > 80%**, offer a **10% discount for rebooking**.  
- If **sunny days with high demand**, **increase price by 15%**.  
- If **storm forecasted**, trigger **"Flexible Rescheduling" option**.  

**Example Pricing Rule in Python:**  
```python
def adjust_price(base_price, cancellation_risk):
    if cancellation_risk > 80:
        return base_price * 0.90  # 10% discount
    elif cancellation_risk < 20:
        return base_price * 1.15  # 15% price increase
    else:
        return base_price

new_price = adjust_price(200, predicted_cancellation_risk)
```

---

### **3.4 Booking System Automation & Alerts**  
📌 *Goal:* **Notify customers & management teams in real-time.**  

🔹 **Guest Alerts (Email/SMS)**  
  - If cancellation risk **>75%**, send **"Storm Alert"** email with flexible rebooking options.  
  - If a guest rebooks, update **CRM & inventory automatically**.  
  - Send **last-minute discount offers** to reduce room vacancies.  

🔹 **Hotel Operations Alerts**  
  - If high cancellations predicted, **adjust housekeeping & staffing**.  
  - If bad weather is forecasted, **increase inventory for indoor activities**.  

**Example Email Alert Automation with Python & Twilio:**  
```python
from twilio.rest import Client

def send_sms_alert(guest_phone, message):
    client = Client("account_sid", "auth_token")
    client.messages.create(to=guest_phone, from_="HotelXYZ", body=message)

if predicted_cancellation_risk > 75:
    send_sms_alert("+1234567890", "Bad weather expected! Reschedule your stay for free!")
```

## **4. Dashboard & Real-Time Monitoring**  
📌 *Goal:* Enable **real-time decision-making** via an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

🔹 **Key Metrics Tracked**  
✅ Cancellation risk (%) by region  
✅ Forecasted revenue loss ($)  
✅ Dynamic price adjustments ($)  
✅ Reschedule & rebooking trends  

🔹 **User Roles & Views**
